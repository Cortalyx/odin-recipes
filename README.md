# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. This project demonstrates fundamental HTML skills by building a simple site with a main index page linking to several individual recipe pages

## Project Overview

Welcome to "Odin Recipes"! This is a simple recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of fundamental HTML concepts by creating a static site that lists various recipes.

## What I'll Be Demonstrating (and Learning!)

By the time I complete this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in:

* **HTML Document Structure:** Setting up the basic skeleton of an HTML page, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
* **Core HTML Elements:** Effectively using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), images (`<img>`), and links (`<a>`).
* **List Structures:** Implementing both unordered lists (`<ul>`) for ingredients and ordered lists (`<ol>`) for recipe steps.
* **Navigation:** Creating clear and functional links between different HTML pages using relative file paths.
* **Git & GitHub Basics:** Utilizing Git for version control (commits, branches, merging) and hosting the project on GitHub.

This project is a stepping stone to more complex web development, focusing purely on content structure before moving on to styling with CSS or interactivity with JavaScript.
