        <h2>How To Make Pesto</h2>
        <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step
           instructions in the pesto recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
           <h3>What is Pesto?</h3>
           <p>Pesto is a vibrant green, fresh-tasting sauce that originated
              in Genoa, Italy. It’s traditionally made with a combination of
              fresh basil, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, garlic, and pine nuts.
              The name “pesto” comes from the Italian word “pestare,” which
              means “to crush.” Though modern recipes (such as this one)
              rely on blenders or food processors, the ingredients for pesto
              are traditionally crushed together using a mortar and pestle. </p>
           <h3>Pesto ingredients</h3>
           <p>These are the simple, fresh ingredients you’ll need to make
              this homemade pesto recipe: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Basil</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Nuts</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Lemon juice</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><h4>Prepare the "dry" ingredients</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the <strong>pine nuts</strong> and <strong>garlic cloves</strong> to the bowl of your food processor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pulse</strong>> a few times until they are finely chopped but not a paste. This helps break them down evenly.</li>
                        <li><em>Optional</em>: Some recipes suggest chilling your food processor bowl and blade, and even the olive oil, to help keep the basil bright green and prevent oxidation.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h4>Add Basil and Seasoning</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the <strong>fresh basil leaves</strong> (ensure they are dry – excess water can make the pesto watery and dull the flavor).</li>
                        <li>Add a <strong>pinch of salt</strong> and a <strong>grinding of black pepper.</strong> Remember, the Parmesan cheese will also add saltiness later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pulse</strong> again until the basil is coarsely chopped and incorporated with the nuts and garlic. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h4>Slowly Drizzle in Olive Oil</h4></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With the food processor <strong>running on low speed</strong> (or pulsing continuously) <strong>slowly drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil</strong> through the feed tube</li>
                        <li>Continue processing until the mixture starts to come together into a relatively smooth, vibrant green sauce. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides a few times.</li>
                        <li><em>Tip:</em> Adding the oil slowly while the machine is running helps emulsify the pesto, giving it a creamier texture and preventing the oil from separating. Avoid over-processing, as too much heat can make the basil turn dark and the oil bitter.</li>      
                    </ul>
                <li><h4>Incorporate the Cheese:</h4></li> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the <strong>freshly grated Parmesan cheese</strong> to the food processor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pulse briefly</strong> just a few times) until the cheese is just combined. You don't want to over-process the cheese.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h4>Taste and Adjust</h4></li> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transfer a small amount to a spoon and <strong>taste</strong> it.</li>
                        <li>Adjust with more salt, pepper, a bit more olive oil (if you prefer a thinner consistency), or even a squeeze of fresh lemon juice (though traditional pesto doesn't include lemon, some like it for brightness and to help prevent browning).</li>
                    </ul>
              </ol>

        <h4>Storage:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Store pesto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
            <li>To prevent browning, you can pour a thin layer of olive oil over the top surface of the pesto before sealing the container.</li>
            <li>Pesto also freezes beautifully in ice cube trays or small containers for longer storage.</li>
        </ul>     
        <p>Enjoy your fresh homemade pesto!</p>
