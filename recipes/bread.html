        <h2>How To Make Classic White Sandwich Bread</h2>
        <p>This recipe yields a soft, tender, and delicious loaf of white bread, perfect for sandwiches, toast, or simply enjoying with butter. It involves a bit of kneading, but the process is straightforward and rewarding.</p>
            <h3>What is Classic White Sandwich Bread?</h3>
            <p>Classic white sandwich bread is a staple in many households, known for its soft crumb and mild flavor. Unlike artisan or rustic breads, it typically has a fine, even texture and a relatively thin, tender crust. It's designed to be pliable for sandwiches and holds up well for toasting. The key steps often include activating yeast, kneading to develop gluten, and two proofing (rising) periods.</p>
            <h3>Classic White Sandwich Bread Ingredients</h3>
            <p>These are the simple ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade classic white sandwich bread:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All-purpose flour (or bread flour for a chewier texture)</li>
                    <li>Warm water (or milk for a richer crumb)</li>
                    <li>Active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>Granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Butter (unsalted, melted)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Activate the Yeast (Proofing the Yeast):</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a large bowl, combine the <strong>warm water (or milk)</strong> and <strong>granulated sugar</strong>. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle the <strong>active dry yeast</strong> over the top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. This indicates the yeast is active.</li>
                        </ul>  
                    <li><h4>Mix the Dough:</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add the <strong>melted butter</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine</li>
                            <li>Gradually add about half of the <strong>flour</strong>, mixing with a wooden spoon until incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Continue adding the remaining flour, a little at a time, until a shaggy dough forms that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. You may not need all the flour.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Knead the Dough:</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Knead</strong> for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and springs back when gently poked. If it's too sticky, add a tiny bit more flour; if it's too dry, a tiny bit of water.</li>
                            <li><em>Tip:</em> To test if it's kneaded enough, perform the "windowpane test": tear off a small piece of dough and gently stretch it. If you can stretch it thin enough to see light through it without tearing, it's ready.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>First Rise (Bulk Fermentation):</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lightly grease a clean large bowl with a little oil.</li>
                            <li>Place the dough in the bowl, turning it once to coat the top.</li>
                            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel.</li>
                            <li>Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Shape the Loaf:</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gently punch down the risen dough to release the air.</li>
                            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                            <li>Shape the dough into a rectangular loaf that will fit snugly into a lightly greased 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan. You can do this by flattening the dough into a rectangle, then rolling it tightly from one long side to the other, pinching the seam closed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Second Rise (Proofing in Pan):</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place the shaped dough into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
                            <li>Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel.</li>
                            <li>Let it rise in a warm place for another 30-45 minutes, or until it has nearly doubled in size and crowned slightly above the rim of the pan.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Bake the Bread:</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preheat your oven to <strong>375°F (190°C)</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 200-210°F (93-99°C) with an instant-read thermometer. If the top browns too quickly, you can loosely tent it with aluminum foil.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Cool Completely:</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove the bread from the oven and immediately turn it out onto a wire rack.</li>
                            <li>Let the loaf cool completely before slicing (at least 1-2 hours). Slicing hot bread can make it gummy.</li>
                        </ul>                             
                </ol>
            <p>Enjoy your freshly baked classic white sandwich bread!</p>
