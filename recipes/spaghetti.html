                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Prepare the Aromatics</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heat the <strong>olive oil</strong> in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
                            <li>Add chopped <strong>onion</strong> and sauté until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add minced <strong>garlic</strong> and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Simmer the Sauce</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pour in the <strong>canned crushed tomatoes</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Stir in <strong>dried oregano, salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper</strong> to taste.</li>
                            <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30 minutes (or longer for more flavor development), stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                            <li>Add fresh basil leaves during the last 5-10 minutes of simmering for a fresh flavor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Cook the Spaghetti</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
                            <li>Add the <strong>spaghetti</strong> nd cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
                            <li>Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. This starchy water can be used to thin the sauce if needed and help it cling to the pasta.</li>
                            <li>Drain the spaghetti thoroughly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Combine and Serve</h4></li>    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add the drained spaghetti directly to the pot with the marinara sauce.</li>
                            <li>Toss well to coat the spaghetti evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
                            <li>Serve hot, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and extra fresh basil, if desired.</li>
                        </ul>        
                </ol>
